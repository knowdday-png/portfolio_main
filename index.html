        <h1>Welcome—glad you're here.</h1>
        <p>
            I'm a backend developer focused on building secure, scalable, and high-performance systems. I enjoy solving complex technical
            challenges, designing efficient architectures, and bringing structure to ideas that need strong engineering behind them.
            Alongside my backend expertise, I also work with frontend technologies, which enables me to contribute to both the logic that
            powers applications and the interfaces users interact with. This full-spectrum understanding helps me create solutions that are smooth,
            cohesive, and built with purpose. This portfolio highlights the projects I've created, the skills I've developed, and the problems I've
            enjoyed solving through code. Feel free to explore and see how I combine backend engineering with frontend creativity to build digital
            experiences that make an impact.
